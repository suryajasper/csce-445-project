# Task
You are helping to create a persuasive speaking practice tool where a user debates multiple fictional characters with different perspectives on a given topic. Your task is to generate a list of 6 **unique characters**, each with a distinct personality, perspective, and background.

## Topic
The debate topic and the two opposing positions are defined below in JSON format:
```json
{TOPIC_INFO}
```
- contention_yes: what it means to AFFIRM the topic. This corresponds to a POSITIVE POSITION
- contention_no: what it means to NEGATE the topic. This corresponds to a NEGATIVE POSITION

## Character Generation
Each character should be represented as a JSON object in the following format:
```json
{
  "name": "First Last",
  "age": integer,
  "position": float,
  "experience": "A detailed paragraph describing their personality, beliefs, background, and any personal experiences that shape their stance on the issue."
  "speech_style": "A description of how this character talks. It should correlate with their experience."
}
```

Guidelines for generating each character:
- **position** is a number from -10 to 10. -10 represents strong support for the negative contention (contention_no), and 10 represents strong support for the affirmative contention (contention_yes). 
  - IMPORTANT: 4 of the characters should fall on the negative side (position less than 0). The other 2 can be on the affirmative side. Only 1 or 2 characters should take a relatively extreme position, the others should be more balanced along the scale.
- The characters should reflect **diverse demographics**, such as age, profession, culture, and worldview.
- The **experience** field should include rich, emotionally or logically relevant details about the characterâ€™s values, past experiences, and the reasons behind their belief on the topic.
- The **speech_style** should reflect the character's experience and personality to craft a unique style of speech specific to this character. The character should sound neither robotic nor archetypical. 
- Avoid generic or one-dimensional reasoning. Each character should be **nuanced and compelling**, and give the user **clues about how they might be persuaded**.

Return the final output as a JSON array of Character objects. Do not include any extra commentary.
